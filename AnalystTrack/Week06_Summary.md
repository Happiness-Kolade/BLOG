## üß∞ Tools & Techniques Used
- **PowerShell**: Used to retrieve and filter Event Logs on Windows.
- **Windows Event Viewer**: Validated log entries visually.
- **Event ID 4104**: Indicator of suspicious PowerShell script block logging.
- **YARA**: Created rules to detect file signatures using hex patterns.
- **Linux Terminal**: Used for testing YARA scans in a Linux environment.

## üîç Example YARA Rule (PDF Magic Bytes)

```yara
rule Detect_PDF_File {
    meta:
        description = "Detects PDF files based on magic bytes"
    strings:
        $pdf_magic = { 25 50 44 46 }  // %PDF
    condition:
        $pdf_magic at 0
}
