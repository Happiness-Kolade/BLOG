# Why I’m Building This Cybersecurity Blog (And What You’ll Get From It)

I didn’t start this blog because I have all the answers — I started it because I’m obsessed with the questions. Questions like:  
*How do I secure a home network from scratch? What does a real SIEM setup look like in action? How do I spot anomalies in packet traffic before damage is done?*

I'm Kolade Happiness, and if you're reading this, it probably means you're just as curious about cybersecurity as I am. This blog is where I put my learning on display — raw, honest, hands-on. I'm not documenting perfection. I'm documenting progress.

## 🔍 Why This Blog Exists

When I first got into cybersecurity, most of what I found was either too theoretical or locked behind a paywall. I wanted something more grounded — something practical. I needed a space to **build in public**, reflect on real projects, and share insights as I go.

That’s what this blog is.  
A **digital lab notebook**. A space for:
- Deep dives into the usage of cybersecurity tools
- Step-by-step project walkthroughs (e.g., setting up DMZs, configuring ACLs)
- Notes on what I’m learning from simulations, case studies, and hands-on work
- Real world layman use cases of cybersecurity, and what could be learnt.

If you're new to cybersecurity, or pivoting into it, or just want to see how someone else is learning the ropes, this space is for you.

## 🧠 What You Can Expect Here

- **Cybersecurity Tutorials** – Simplified, practical, and often based on real tools and environments  
- **Project Logs** – I’ll break down my simulations and builds, including what went wrong and how I fixed it  
- **Tool Walkthroughs** – Explorations of technologies I’m working with, from Cisco to cloud  
- **Learning Notes** – Short posts on concepts, strategies, or mistakes worth reflecting on  
- **Occasional Rants** – Because this field is wild, and sometimes, you've got to process it out loud

## 🎯 My Approach

I believe in **learning by doing**. I don’t just want to know how something works — I want to build it, break it, and fix it again. That’s how real knowledge sticks.

This blog will reflect that mindset:  
✅ Real-world practice over perfect theory  
✅ Progress over polish  
✅ Clarity over buzzwords
