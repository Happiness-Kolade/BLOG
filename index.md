# 👋 Hi, I'm Happiness

Welcome to my personal blog — a space where I share insights, walkthroughs, and practical projects from my journey in cybersecurity.

### 🔐 What I Do

I’m passionate about **digital security**, **network defense**, and using **hands-on projects** to stay ahead in the evolving cyber threat landscape. This blog is where I document my learning process, break down concepts, and offer helpful guides for fellow cybersecurity enthusiasts and learners.

### 🧠 What to Expect

- **Cybersecurity Tutorials**  
  From beginner concepts to real-world implementations — think firewalls, SIEM, threat analysis, packet sniffing, and more.

- **Project Updates**  
  I regularly build and simulate security environments (e.g. Cisco Packet Tracer networks, SIEM workflows with Azure Sentinel, etc). I break down each project, challenges I faced, and how I solved them.

- **Thoughts & Learnings**  
  Posts on what I’m discovering in the cybersecurity field — tools, trends, and career tips.
