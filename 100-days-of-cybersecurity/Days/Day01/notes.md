## Day 1: Dusting Off Kali & Learning Linux Basics

I had to open up Kali Linux, dust it, throw it out of the shelf, and then bring it back in.

### ðŸ”¹ What I Did:
I spun up a fresh Kali Linux virtual machine and walked through basic Linux commandsâ€”`ls`, `pwd`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `touch`, `nano`, `rm`, and more. Simple as they seem, each one acts as a building block for navigating the terminal like a pro.

### ðŸ”¹ Why I Did It:
Because Linux is the native tongue of cybersecurity. Whether you're a Red Teamer probing for vulnerabilities or a Blue Teamer analyzing logs, understanding Linux is foundational. Kali Linux, being a security-focused distro, is loaded with tools. But without an adequate knowledge of the terminal, those tools are out of reach.

### ðŸ”¹ Why It Matters:
This isn't just about typing commands. It's about confidence. It's about building muscle memory and removing fear of the terminal. It's about preparing to automate, to script, to monitor, to investigate, and ultimately, to secure.
